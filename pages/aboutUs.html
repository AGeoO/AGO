        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/q1h3352516p31104702">Atavic;</a></li>

        <h2>The AGO Constitution</h2>
        <h3>Participation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Participation in the AGO is done by contacting the committee only, the person wishing to participate must present their reason in the <b>#can-i-cook</b> chat. The reason must include who or where they heard about the competition and why they want to participate. The committee will assign the "trusted" role to people who have shown a coherent reason.</li>

          <li>Contestants who achieved a medal in the Portuguese/British MO (PorMO/BMO) category can no longer participate in this category.</li>

          <li>If a contestant is found to have cheated, they will be banned from taking part in current and future AGOs, unless they are pardoned by the current AGO leader.</li>

          <li>Members of the AGO committee cannot participate in the AGOs.</b>

          <li>During the weekends in which the given category takes part, the contestant can start taking the paper at any time, i.e. the contestant can choose the timeslot where they want to start the paper. To do this, run the <code>+ready</code> command in <b>#commands</b>. The contestant will then receive a message from the AGO Contest Manager bot with instructions on how to start. Note that once the contestant uses the <code>+start</code> command, there is no turning back!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Contest Regulations</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The PorMO/BMO category takes place on a weekend day. The paper consists of 3 problems of similar difficulty to Portuguese Mathematical Olympiad and British Mathematical Olympiad, which have to be solved in 3 hours.</li>

          <li>The IMO/RMM category takes place over two weekend days, with each day corresponding to a part. In the 1st part, the paper consists of 3 problems of similar difficulty to the International Mathematical Olympiad, which have to be solved in 4.5 hours. In the 2nd part, the paper consists of 3 problems of similar difficulty to Romanian Masters of Mathematics, which have to be solved in 4.5 hours. </li>

          <li>In each paper, after the timeslot is over, the contestants have a maximum of 30 minutes to submit their solutions. For example, after 3 hours in the PorMO/BMO category, they have 30 minutes to submit their work. Any solution sent after the tolerance time will be annulled.</li>

          <li><b>Solutions that include bash techniques from the following list will lose a maximum of 4 points</b> 
            <ul>
              <li>Complex bash</li>
              <li>Barycentric bash</li>
              <li>Analytic bash</li>
              <li>Higher dimension bash</li>
              <li>Calculus</li>

          <li>During the weekend when a category date is taking place, <b>no problems must be shared</b> until the committee itself gives permission.</li>

          <li>The use of external lemmas must be followed by a link to the lemma, and it must be shown how the lemma will be used in the solution. Using expressions such as "it is well known that..." without proper citation of the motto will not be tolerated.</li>

          <li>The use of expressions such that "by easy angle chase" will not be tolerated.</li>

          <li>Submitted solutions must be written in Portuguese or English.</li> 

          <li>Submitted solutions must be legible; otherwise they will be ignored.</li>
